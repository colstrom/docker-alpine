* Overview

~package~ is a wrapper around system package management tools, intended for use
in automated build systems. It provides a consistent interface for common
packaging operations, and supports pluggable backends.

* Usage

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  # package install fish
#+END_EXAMPLE

This would fetch an up-to-date package index, install ~fish~, and then remove
the package index, cache, and temp files.

* Supported Backends

- apk
- apt-get
- brew
