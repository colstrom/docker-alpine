alpine
======

[Alpine Linux](https://alpinelinux.org/) is a security-oriented, lightweight Linux distribution based on musl libc and busybox.

Description
-----------
All tags for this image are [Edge](http://wiki.alpinelinux.org/wiki/Edge) builds of Alpine Linux. They differ only in which repositories are included. If you need a stable version, [alpine](https://hub.docker.com/r/_/alpine/) provides tags for those. As the intent of this image is to be a minimal base for single-service containers, tracking `edge` is not expected to cause issues (packages are still stable releases, only Alpine itself is a development build).

Tags
----
  * `main`, `edge`, or `latest` includes only the `main` repository.
